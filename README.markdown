# Twitter Text (PHP Edition) - modified #

This library is heavily based on the Twitter Text (PHP Edition), but has been
rewritten to just support hashtags and users. The users supported here have
the same limits as hashtags.

## Features ##

### Extractor ###

 - Extract mentioned usernames (from anywhere in the text).
 - Extract all valid hashtags.
 - Support for international character sets.

## Thanks & Contributions ##

The bulk of this library is from the heroic efforts of:

 - Matt Sanford (https://github.com/mzsanford): For the orignal Ruby and Java implementions.
 - Mike Cochrane (https://github.com/mikenz): For the initial PHP code.
 - Nick Pope (https://github.com/ngnpope): For the bulk of the maintenance work to date.
 - Takashi Nojima (https://github.com/nojimage): For ongoing maintenance work.
